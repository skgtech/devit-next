          <DarkLeading>
            Every year we are setting the bar higher and deliver a world-class conference on web
            development.
          </DarkLeading>
          <p>
            DEVit started in 2015 and it takes place every year in Thessaloniki, Greece. It is
            known for its top speaking talent, a mixture of world-class and world-renowned
            developers, highly specialized technology niches and developers who are on the edge
            of technology frontiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attendees of the conference are mostly highly trained and motivated web
            developers, representing the cream of the crop in talent South East Europe has to
            offer. DEVit, now in its fourth year, has become the defacto meeting point of all
            seasoned web development professionals.
